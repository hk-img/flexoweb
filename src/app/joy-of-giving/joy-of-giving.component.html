  <h2>Joy of Giving</h2>
  <p>
    Real happiness lies in making others happy. At Flexo, we strive to spread joy by giving back to society and to
    Mother Nature.</p>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
    As part of our Joy Of Giving initiative, we plant a fruit tree in your name for every long-term desk that you book
    through us.
  </p>
  <!-- <h3>Founder's Journey</h3>
  <p>
    The trees that are planted bear fruit for about 20-25 years, benefiting farmers and rural communities for decades to
    come. All the trees we plant are geo-tagged, visible on google maps and can be tracked online.

      <p>
        While we can never give back what we take from Nature, we strive to make our planet more sustainable by
        contributing in a small but meaningful way. Planting trees helps prevent soil erosion, increases land fertility
        and mitigates global warming.

      <p>
        This is a small action towards helping create a world that recognizes the environment as a stakeholder, a world
        that is filled with generosity and a world that gives back as it evolves. We wish to do more with your support.
        Let's work towards creating a better place for all of us to live in because there's no greater joy than the one
        there is in giving.
